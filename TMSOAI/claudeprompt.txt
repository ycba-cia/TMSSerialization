Original prompt:
create a ruby on rails app that will implement 6 routes: GetRecord, Identify,ListIdentifiers,ListMetadataFormats,ListRecords,ListSets as described here https://www.openarchives.org/OAIopenarchivesprotocol.html#ProtocolMessages. Note the Arguments, Error and Exception Conditions, and see Examples if that helps.

When asked to create model:
Don't create the model for now


Perfect! I've successfully created a Ruby on Rails application that implements all 6 OAI-PMH protocol verbs. Here's what was built:

  Application Structure

  Routes configured:
  - /oai (GET/POST) - Main OAI-PMH endpoint
  - / (root) - Also points to OAI endpoint

  Implemented Verbs (app/controllers/oai_controller.rb)

  1. Identify - Returns repository information
  2. ListMetadataFormats - Lists supported formats (oai_dc, oai_marc)
  3. ListSets - Lists available sets for selective harvesting
  4. ListIdentifiers - Returns record headers based on criteria
  5. ListRecords - Returns full records with metadata
  6. GetRecord - Retrieves a specific record by identifier

  Key Features

  - Full error handling with all OAI-PMH error codes (badArgument, badVerb, cannotDisseminateFormat, idDoesNotExist, etc.)
  - Argument validation for required/optional parameters
  - Date validation supporting both granularities (YYYY-MM-DD and ISO8601)
  - Multiple metadata formats (Dublin Core and MARC)
  - Sample data included for testing (2 sample records)
  - Proper XML responses using Nokogiri with correct namespaces

  Testing

  You can start the server and test immediately:

  rails server

  Then test with cURL:
  curl "http://localhost:3000/oai?verb=Identify"
  curl "http://localhost:3000/oai?verb=GetRecord&identifier=oai:example.org:item1&metadataPrefix=oai_dc"

  The README.md file contains comprehensive documentation with examples for all verbs. The application is ready to extend with a real database model when needed - just replace the sample_records method with actual database queries.
